# **Penetration Testing Report**

## **1. Introduction**

### **Purpose and Scope of the Report**
This report documents the penetration testing conducted on the **user registration system** of the **Booking System (Phase 1)**. The goal of this test was to identify security vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices, particularly in areas such as **input validation, data encryption**.

### **Testing Schedule and Environment**
- **Testing Date:** 02-18-2025
- **Environment:** Localhost (`http://localhost:8000/register`)
- **Testing Methodology:** A combination of automated scanning using ZAP and manual analysis.
- **Testing User:** Created a test account (`joker/joker123`) for testing.

### **Scope of Testing**
- **Tested Component:** User Registration Page (only)
- **Excluded:** Login, Resource Booking, Administrator Functions (not implemented in Phase 1)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Input Validation (SQL Injection, Path Traversal)
  - Data Encryption & Storage Security

### **Methods and Tools Used for Testing**
- **ZAP** â€“ Automated scanning and active attack testing.
- **Kali Linux** â€“ Environment for penetration testing.
- **Chromium Developer Tools** â€“ Inspecting HTTP requests.
- **PostgreSQL Queries** â€“ Analyzing database security.

## **2. Summary**

### **Key Findings and Recommendations**
1. **SQL Injection in Registration Form (Critical)**  
   - The registration form is vulnerable to **SQL Injection**, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.  
   - **Fix:** Use **prepared statements** and **input sanitization**.

2. **Passwords Stored in Plaintext (High)**  
   - The database stores **plaintext passwords**, which is a **major security risk** and **GDPR non-compliant**.  
   - **Fix:** Implement **bcrypt** or **Argon2** hashing for password storage.

3. **Path Traversal Vulnerability (High)**  
   - ZAP identified a **Path Traversal vulnerability**, indicating improper file path validation.  
   - **Fix:** Sanitize user input and restrict file access.

### **General Assessment of System Security**
The system has **critical security flaws**, including **SQL Injection, Path Traversal, lack of password encryption, and improper input validation**. Immediate fixes are required to **prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations**.

## **3. Findings and Categorization**

### **ðŸ”´ 1. SQL Injection in Registration Form (Critical)**
**Risk Level:** ðŸ”´ **Critical**  
**Description:**  
- The registration form **does not properly validate user input**, allowing **SQL Injection**.
- Attackers can **manipulate database queries** to extract or modify data.

**Evidence:**  
SQL Injection payload tested:  
```sql
username=admin' OR '1'='1' -- &password=test123

The output of the query was as follows:

| username | password  |
|----------|-----------|
| joker    | joker123  |
| admin    | admin123  |

The passwords are stored in plaintext, making the system susceptible to unauthorized access.

### Recommendations:
- âœ… Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- âœ… Sanitize user input to remove SQL special characters.
